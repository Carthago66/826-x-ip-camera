The camera has an SD card slot.

However, when SD card is enabled in the GUI, it formats the card with a proprietary filesystem (?).

It would be nice to be able to run a new FS off the SD card.  

However, attempts to boot from the SD card were inclusive:

1. putting the original FS on the SDcard and asking uboot to boot it seemed to work (but the software promptly erased it...).

2. putting a modified squashfs (made using the mksquashfs from the SDK) on the SD card did not boot.  (maybe it is checksummed in some way?)


It would be nice to use the SD card with VFAT.

Attempts to put files in a FAT32 filesystem on the card (e.g. to allow simple modifications and extra storage) resulted in the SD card beign erased, even if disabled in the UI.

Tests were not done rigourously....
The FS on the formatted card was not easily identifiable.
