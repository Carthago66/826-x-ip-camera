The upgrade file was obtained as follows:

On a router through which the IP data is flowing, run
tcpdump  -nnvXSs 0 -i any host <ip of camera>
on the camera (whilst offered an upgrade), request the upgrade.
Note the file requested.

In my case this was 
ipc_pack_patch_from_v4.6.2.1706161621.rtl8188fu_to_v5.1.5.1803281502.rtl8188fu.bin
(unfortunately I don't have a log of exactly where from).
download this file using your browser.

The ipc_pack format has a fairly simple layout, discovered using the hex editor HxD:

8 byte Header:
69 70 63 5F 70 61 63 6B - 'ipc_pack'

Each of the next sections conforms to the style 
tag - 1 byte, 
size - 4 bytes, 
data - size bytes.

the file proceeds with:


01 
00 00 00 04 
00 00 00 02  // ?? version??  must be 2??

0B 
00 00 00 04 
00 D7 C8 00  // size of tar within /backupfs/ipc_project_v4.6.2.1706161621.rtl8188fu.tar.lzma  = 0xd7c800

0C 
00 00 00 04 
00 DF 98 00  // size of new tar once patch has been applied

0D 
00 00 00 04 
D5 8F D4 9A  // CRC32 tar within /backupfs/ipc_project_v4.6.2.1706161621.rtl8188fu.tar.lzma

Successful manual patching of the ipc_patch file can be achieved like this:

using HxD on windows.
Open the upgrade file.
Locate the script file, on the right hand side highlight the script file content, and copy it out.  Paste it into your favourite linux line endiing compatible editor.
Edit the script file to implement what you need.... and copy the resulting text.
Paste into the right hand side of HxD over the original data.  Highlight the pasted data and note the size (indicated in hex at the bottom of HxD).
Locate the 4 bytes for the script size, and overwrite them with the new size.
Go to the end of the file, and overwrite the 4 byte CRC value with 00 00 00 00.
Highlight the whole file from the eigth byte onwards.
Ask HxD to give you the CRC32.
Enter the new CRC into the CRC bytes.
Save the file under a new name.

Go to the camera local web UI, and in Settings/System, use Upload Upgrade to upload your new file.
A few seconds later, it will offer you to Restart.

Once restarted, your new script will be in place.

Example script updates are in 
ipc_pack_patch_from_v1.7.1.1503091547_to_v1.9.5.1510231507.updated.zip
and
ipc_pack_patch_from_v4.6.2.1706161621.rtl8188fu_to_v5.1.5.1803281502.rtl8188fu.updated.zip

Note: this procedure works on cameras based on firmware v4.6.2.1706161621.rtl8188fu, other base firmwares are untested.

I had assumed that a factory reset would remove the firmware update, but it did not on my camera, so if you have a camera based on a different firmware update, you may need to get creative to obtain a working upgrade image.
